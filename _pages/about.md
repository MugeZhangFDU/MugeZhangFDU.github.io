My name is Muge Zhang, a prospective CS PhD student. I am currently completing my Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Computer Science at Fairleigh Dickinson University, expecting to graduate in December 2024. I have had the opportunity to work under the guidance of Dr. Jeeho Ryoo and Dr. Wenyun Dai at the Gildart Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering.

I have extensive work experience in software engineering and backend development. I worked for two years at WeFind AI, an AI startup in Beijing, and I am currently interning as a backend developer at Binance US.

My current research interests lie in ML/AI, systems optimization, and data-driven algorithms. I am particularly focused on enhancing the performance and efficiency of AI models and computational systems, with applications across scalable data processing and intelligent systems.
